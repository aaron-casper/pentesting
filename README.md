# pentesting
A collection of python stuff I've written to automate some pentesting tasks.  Mostly these were an excuse for me to learn a different GUI framework for python.

All responsibility for use of this software lies with the user.  These are tools intended to be used for verifying the security of your own credentials, or in authorized penetration testing.

I am not responsible or liable for any damage, including but not limited to bricked network gear and/or deceased pets.  Let's be honest, if you're using these to illegally breach something, you're probably going to get caught.

Now, on to the files!
Anything without 'cli' on the filename is a UI tool and requires AppJar + X + probably some other stuff.  They all have "help" buttons too!

Here's the CLI 'readme' you get for each without using any args:


./dictsmasher2_cli.py 
==================================
the mighty dictsmasher, by floz
==================================
mashes random word + [len]-digit random int

usage:
dictsmasher.py [file] [len] [attempts]

file should be a newline-seperated dictionary
of words/strings

runs until [attempts] is exhausted
enter 0 [attempts] to run until stopped (ctrl+c)

./dictsmasher_cli.py 
==================================
the mighty dictsmasher, by floz
==================================
mashes word + 1or2-digit int + word + 1or2-digit int
as seen on newer VZ access points

usage:
dictsmasher.py [file] [attempts]

file should be a newline-seperated dictionary
of words/strings

runs until [attempts] is exhausted
enter 0 [attempts] to run until stopped (ctrl+c)

./twc_barfer_cli.py 
==================================
the original TWC barfer, by floz
==================================
barfs model+garbage characters
technically just counts in HEX
usage:
twc_barfer.py [garbage length] [model]

example:
python twc_barfer.py 4 TC8715D
: TC8715DFD4E
: TC8715DFD4F

./garbagebarfer.py 
==================================
the mighty garbage barfer, by floz
==================================
barfs garbage characters

usage:
python garbagebarfer.py [len] [attempts]

it will then spew out randomized
passwords of length [len]

until [attempts] is reached

./phonebarfer_cli.py 
=======================================
the mighty phone number barfer, by floz
=======================================
barfs phone numbers in squence
from the prefix/area provided

usage:
phonebarfer.py [pfx][area]
it will then go through [pfx][area]-0000
up to [pfx][area]-9999 in sequence
outputs to stdout, pipeable

./webscraper_cli.py 
==================================
a crappy web scraper, by floz
==================================
dumps a raw grab of the URL/URI

dumps it all out to stdout

then lists <P> and <A> elements

from the raw scrape.
==================================
usage:
webscraper.py [url] > [filename]

example:
webscraper.py http://google.com > google.txt
